	<h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
	<p>My current short-term goals are to continue to work full time as an editor for a government contractor while I finish my master's degree in English literature. Given that I am taking one class at a time, this may take me until summer or fall of 2027. In my current professional role, I aim to continue to polish and develop advanced editing techniques and skills while taking on challenging proposals and tasks. I hope to be growing professionally within my organization and taking on additional responsibilities.</p>

	<h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
	<p>Long term, my vision is to continue to write so that one day, I can publish a book. I am currently workshopping ideas and have several ideas for children's and young adult books. I also began writing a novel in my Novel class that I took in the Spring of 2024 and hope to continue writing that as well.</p>
