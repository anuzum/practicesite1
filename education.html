  <h1><b>EDUCATION</b></h1>
  <p>I earned my bachelor of arts degree at The College of William and Mary, and while I started out wanting to major in English, I ended up majoring in psychology with a minor in sociology. I then earned my master of arts and educational specialist degrees in counseling psychology from James Madison University. I am now back to English, my original passion and interest, and am happy to be pursuing my graduate degree at George Mason University.</p>
