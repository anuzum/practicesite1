  <h1><b>EXPERIENCE</b></h1>
  <p>I started out my career in psychology research, and after earning my first graduate degree, worked in the field of counseling, specifically with the foster care community. I then took a career break when I had my children and took on various volunteer roles in which I pursued what I love: writing and editing. My career break helped me realize what my ultimate goal was: to return to English, work as a writer/editor, and pursue a graduate degree in the field.</p>
